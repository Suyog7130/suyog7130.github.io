<h3> Here's some fun facts about me: </h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;üëã&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Suyog and I am a scientist!
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;üëÄ&nbsp;&nbsp; I love Astrophysics, Books, Places and People.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;üå±&nbsp;&nbsp; My research is on using Machine Learning for Gravitational-Wave Detections.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;üíª&nbsp;&nbsp; I have experience in Data Analysis, Numerical Solvers and Deep Neural Networks.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;üíûÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be awesome to collaborate on a computational project together :)
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;üì´&nbsp;&nbsp; Catch up about my work on this website ~

Heya, this is Suyog. Currently, I am a Physics PhD student working with Prof <a href="https://www.resceu.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kipp/">Kipp Cannon</a> at the <a href="http://www.resceu.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">Research Center for Early Universe</a>, the <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html">University of Tokyo</a>. My primary research focus is on detection and data analysis methods for Gravitational waves, with some applications of machine learning tuned in. At UTokyo, I am supported by the embassy-recommended <a href="https://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/koutou/ryugaku/06032818.htm">MEXT Scholarship</a> and the <a href="https://aspire-gw.com/">ASPIRE-GW</a> program, together with a few more short-term research grants. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justified">
My research and other interests are broad and indiscriminate. And so are my hobbies and experiences, ranging from dabbling in cutting-edge Machine Learning research to masquerading as a wannabe writer. You can find more about these on this website.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justified">
Prior to RESCEU, I was a master's student at the <a href="https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">Institute of Cosmic Ray Research</a>, UTokyo. My undergraduate degree is in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Design and Manufacturing, from <a href="https://iiitdm.ac.in/">IIITDM Kancheerpuram</a>, Chennai. Previously, during the COVID times, I was also a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/5365547692195840">Google Summer of Code</a> student in 2021. Much earlier than that, I was born and raised in a quaint little town called <a href="https://mandla.nic.in/en/">Mandla</a> in the heart of India, amidst a pleasant life full of stories, warm summers, trees, and books.

<!-- wobble class needs to be defined before the JS code that makes the text wobble, and there seems to be a problem with the word spacing with,
Okay, I slightly modified the JS code to have word wobbling instead of individual letters and then added spacing between the returned wobbling words.
See and experiment: https://codepen.io/queenadreena/pen/oKGyYq
hmm... the hyperlink doesn't work when wobbling :(
okay, I did plethora of things, but on webpage upload the wobbling stops and it doens't seem to be a `table` env problem. So, let's not have this up on the webpage for now.
And also, perhaps, having this manual public isn't the best of the ideas, that Ueda-san can be nasty, when she wants to be, haha!
