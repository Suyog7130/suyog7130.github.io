My current PhD research relates to gravitational-wave Astrophysics. Over the past few years, I have broadly worked on computational astrophysics and data analysis topics. Below is a brief description and summary of my research interests. Some projects have their own pages.

---

## Gravitational Waves

### Generating gravitational waveform approximations using machine learning models


### Detections of gravitational waves from compact object mergers

---

## Stellar and Solar Physics

### Stellar magnetic cycles and variability

### Super-resolving the solar magnetograms

---

## Other Interests

### AGNs and X-Ray Emissions

### Dark Matter Halos and the Uchuu simulation

### Internal structure of Neutron Stars

### Machine Learning
