# Cloudflare Pages — Hosting Guide for Jennie’s Dating Scorecard

This app is a static front‑end (HTML/CSS/JS) that calls a Google Apps Script backend. Cloudflare Pages is perfect to host the static files over HTTPS (needed for PWA).

## What you need
- A Cloudflare account (free is fine).
- Your app folder with: `index.html`, `app.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`, `icons/`.
- Your **Apps Script Web App URL** pasted into `app.js` as `GAS_ENDPOINT`.

---

## Quick Deploy (Upload Assets)
1. Log in to Cloudflare → **Pages** → **Create a project** → **Upload assets**.
2. Drag‑drop your folder (the one that contains `index.html` at the root).
3. Project name: something like **dating-scorecard**.
4. Build settings:
   - **Framework preset:** None
   - **Build command:** None
   - **Output directory:** `/` (root where `index.html` lives)
5. Click **Save and Deploy**. In ~30s you’ll get a `*.pages.dev` URL.

> Hash routes like `#scorecard` require no special SPA rewrites, so you’re good.

---

## Custom Domain (optional)
1. In Pages → your project → **Settings → Domains → Set up a custom domain**.
2. Enter your domain (or subdomain) and follow the wizard. Cloudflare will set a CNAME and provision SSL automatically.

---

## PWA Checklist on Pages
- Site is on HTTPS (Pages provides it).
- `manifest.webmanifest` resolves (open it directly to verify).
- `sw.js` is served at the site root and registers without console errors.
- After a minute of use, you should see **Install** option (button or browser menu).

---

## Caching & Updates
- Cloudflare Pages caches aggressively; the service worker also caches the app shell.
- If you push an update and don’t see it:
  1. Hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R).
  2. In DevTools → Application → Service Workers → **Update** / **Unregister** → reload.
- Pages keeps previous deploys; you can **Rollback** from the dashboard.

---

## Hiding the Apps Script URL (optional)
By default, `GAS_ENDPOINT` is visible in `app.js`. To hide it and add a shared secret, place a tiny **Cloudflare Worker** in front of Apps Script:

```js
// worker.js (deploy as a Worker or Pages Function)
export default {
  async fetch(req, env) {
    const url = new URL(req.url);
    if (url.pathname.startsWith('/api/')) {
      const upstream = new URL(env.APPS_SCRIPT_URL);
      upstream.search = url.search; // keep ?action=...&id=...
      const init = {
        method: req.method,
        headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},
      };
      if (req.method !== 'GET') {
        const body = await req.text();
        // inject a secret into JSON if you like
        init.body = body && body.length ? body : null;
      }
      const r = await fetch(upstream, init);
      return new Response(r.body, {status:r.status, headers:r.headers});
    }
    return new Response('Not found', {status:404});
  }
}
```

- Bind a secret **APPS_SCRIPT_URL** in Worker settings.
- In `app.js`, set `GAS_ENDPOINT = location.origin + '/api'`.
- Route `/api*` to the worker in **Workers → Triggers** (or use Pages Functions in the same repo).

This keeps the Apps Script URL private and allows you to add auth later.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **“Check Connection” fails:** Ensure Apps Script deploy is **Web app → Anyone**. If using Worker proxy, check the bound secret and logs.
- **PWA not installable:** Make sure `manifest.webmanifest` and icons are present, and that the page was visited over HTTPS for a bit (the prompt can be finicky).
- **Images not saving:** Check Drive quota, App Script logs (`View → Executions`), and that your `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` (if set) is valid.
- **404s on deep links:** You’re using hash routes (`#scorecard`), so should be fine. If you ever switch to path routes, add a SPA rewrite to `index.html` in Pages settings.
