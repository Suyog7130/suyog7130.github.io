iMac when used with bluetooth Apple keyboards and mouse has a faintly annoying problem of the inability to use the mouse if it doesn't automatically gets connected to the system. A possible remedy and workaround for this is to use keyboard keys for mouse control.

- Press `F8` (or `F7` in the Macbook) key on the keyboard to enable switching the command palettes in the settings window.
- Use the `Tab` to scroll up and down in the command palette.
- Use the `Space` bar to make the selection click at the desired command.
