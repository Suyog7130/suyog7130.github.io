How to convert PDF to JPG/PNG (images) via command line prompts on MacOS `zsh` terminal.

STEP 1 : Install `poppler` via ```brew install poppler```

STEP 2a : If you only wanna convert one file, run,
```zsh
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 300 path-to-input-folder/**/*.pdf path-to-output-folder/*
```

STEP 2b : If you wanna loop through all the files in then execute,
```zsh
for file in path-to-input-folder/**/*; do pdftoppm -jpeg -r 300 $file path-to-output-folder/*; done;
```
