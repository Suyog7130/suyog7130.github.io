When you can’t attend or might be late to a **recurring Zoom meeting**, the safest way to ensure class or group can begin on time is to let a trusted colleague **start the meeting for you**.

> **Key point:** In Zoom, a **co‑host** can help manage a running meeting **but cannot start it**. For starting the meeting without you, use **Alternative host** (recommended), or **Host key + Join before host** (backup), or **Scheduling privilege** (for ongoing delegation).

---

## Option A — Recommended: Add an **Alternative host**

**What it does:** A designated **Licensed** user on the **same Zoom account** can **start the meeting on your behalf**. They’ll receive an email with a special start link.

**Steps (web portal, works for already‑scheduled or recurring meetings):**

1. Sign in at **zoom.us** → **Meetings** → **Upcoming**.  
2. Click the meeting title. For a recurring series, choose **Edit** → **Edit All Occurrences** (or *This Occurrence* if you prefer one week only).  
3. In the meeting edit view, find **Alternative hosts** and enter the colleague’s **Zoom account email** (multiple addresses separated by commas).  
4. **Save**. Your colleague will get an email confirming they can start the meeting.  
5. (Optional) Repeat to add a second backup.

**Notes**  
- Alternative hosts must be **Licensed** and typically on the **same institutional account**. If they’re external and you cannot add them, use **Option B** or **Option C** instead.  
- The alternative host who starts the meeting becomes the **Host** until you join; you can reclaim host on entry.

## Option B — Backup: **Host key** + **Join before host**

**What it does:** You allow participants to enter before you and give a trusted colleague your **6‑digit Host Key** so they can **claim host** from the Participants panel.

**Steps:**

1. **Enable “Join before host”** for the meeting (and **turn off Waiting Room** for that meeting).  
   - Edit the meeting → enable **Allow participants to join before host** (choose time window) and disable **Waiting Room** for that meeting.  
2. **Find your Host Key**: zoom.us → **Profile** → scroll to **Host Key** → **Show** (you can **Edit** to change it).  
3. Share that 6‑digit code *privately* with the colleague.  
4. They join the meeting early → **Participants** → **Claim Host** → enter the **Host Key** → they become **Host** and can run the session.

**Cautions**  
- Keep the Host Key confidential; rotate it later if needed.  
- “Join before host” and “Waiting Room” conflict; Waiting Room must be off for host‑less start.

## Option C — Ongoing delegation: **Scheduling privilege**

**What it does:** Grant a colleague permanent permission to **schedule and start meetings on your behalf** (they can also act as **Alternative host** for those meetings). Good for long‑running weekly courses.

**Steps:**

1. Sign in at zoom.us → **Settings** (or **Profile**) → scroll to **Schedule Privilege**.  
2. **Assign** your colleague (must be **Licensed** on the same account).  
3. They can schedule your meetings, start them, access cloud recordings, and manage reports for those delegated meetings.

## Quick checklist (for a weekly class)

- [ ] Add at least **one Alternative host** (same account, Licensed).  
- [ ] If external support is required, enable **Join before host**, **disable Waiting Room** for that meeting, and share your **Host Key** with the designated person.  
- [ ] For long‑term coverage, set up **Scheduling privilege**.  
- [ ] Remind the starter to use the **email address** associated with their Zoom license when joining.

## Why “co‑host” isn’t enough

A **co‑host** helps manage **during** a meeting (mute all, manage participants, share screen, etc.) but **cannot start** a scheduled meeting. Use **Alternative host** to allow starting without you; once you join, you can remain host or take host back.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Alternative host can’t be added** → They might not be Licensed or on a different account. Use **Host Key** or **Scheduling privilege**, or ask IT to add them to your account.  
- **Participants can’t enter before host** → Check that **Join before host** is enabled **and** **Waiting Room** is off for that meeting (these settings conflict).  
- **Colleague can’t claim host** → Confirm they clicked **Participants → Claim Host** and entered the correct **6‑digit Host Key** from your profile.  
- **Recurring meeting** → When editing, choose **Edit All Occurrences** to apply changes to every week.
