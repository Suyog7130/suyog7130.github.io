A log of Zotero issues, I have encountered.

---

The the Zotero chrome connector doesn't always work. This issue arises sporadically every now and then. A workaround I devised for this is to use the webpage version of the zotero library via login to the website. The library is available at: [https://www.zotero.org/suyoggarg/mylibrary/](https://www.zotero.org/suyoggarg/collections/U8AAVCPJ/items/R6EYB749/item-list)

Then any new item can be manually added using the identifier, for example the DOI or the URL of the page. However, BibTex export via Better-BibTex will still require the software download and full library sync. These issues may also be arising due to improper device resources allocation, for instance, when the CPU is busy with some other tasks.

- Issue: Zotero freezes, items don't load and the application doesn't respond.
- Reason: Possibly due to adding too many feeds and the syncing issue.

- Issue: Zootmoov didn't sync recent files.
- Solution: Select affected files, `right click`$ \rightarrow$ `Move them to directory with Zootmoov`
