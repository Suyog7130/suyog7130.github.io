A log of Zotero issues, I have encountered.

---

- Date: 2025/03/18
- Issue: Zotero freezes, items don't load and the application doesn't respond.
- Reason: Possibly due to adding too many feeds and the syncing issue.

- Date: 2025/03/18
- Issue: Zootmoov didn't sync recent files.
- Solution: Select affected files, `right click`$ \rightarrow$ `Move them to directory with Zootmoov`
